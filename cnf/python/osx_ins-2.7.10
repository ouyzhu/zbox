# Make gets following info on Yosemite, but seems OK, python works
#	Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
#	bsddb185           dl                 gdbm
#	imageop            linuxaudiodev      ossaudiodev
#	readline           spwd               sunaudiodev
#
# Problem: missing readline is inconvinent, since can NOT use arrow key in interactive mode
# Solution: (not verified) '' might work
